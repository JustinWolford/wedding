                        <ul>
                            <li>Wedding party will need to be there early for being dressed and for photos at 12noon, parents of the bride and groom at 12:30pm.</li>
                            <li>Wedding ceremony is at 2pm.</li>
                            <li>Reception is scheduled to end at 7:30pm.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Dress Code</h4>
                        <p>
                                “Casual but not too casual. Dressing up is allowed. Outdoor-friendly footwear.” What does that mean? No jeans, please! Nice shirts (collared shirt, Aloha shirts, blouses) or dress. Khaki shorts would be fine. Slippers a.k.a. “flip flops” are fine. :) It also means you can dress up, if you’d like. It’s safe: the bride will be wearing a traditional wedding dress and the groom will be wearing a tie and vest. We do not recommend spiked heels, as the event is on the grass.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Menu</h4>
                        <p>This isn't the lovely version of the menu provided by our fabulous caterer (friend of Justin's grandparents who used to live on Maui), Bev Gannon, but we’ll have teriyaki chicken and a couple alternative proteins (edamame and another meat), sticky rice, stir-fried veggies, fruit, and rolls.  </p>
                        <p>For the cake, family-friend and renowned bakery-owner Harold Hardcastle is kindly gifting us a beautiful wedding cake. There will also be a gluten-free, egg-free cake so hopefully everyone can enjoy a slice of some sort of cake. Our fabulous caterer will also be providing an ice cream sundae bar, with a non-dairy option.</p>
                        <p>For beverages, wine, beer, and champagne will be served along with non-alcoholic beverage options that will include the kid-friendly POG (pineapple orange guava juice) of Justin’s childhood.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Entertainment</h4>
                        <p>We’re still fine-tuning details, but there should be a variety of options for how you can entertain yourself and get to know others, including music and a dance floor, but not limited to it! :)</p>

                        Why did we choose to get married on Maui when there are so many places that are <i>not</i> Maui to choose from? When we both have lived in Oregon so long? Well, Justin is from Maui, and Abi and Justin have made many memories there. The wedding venue is actually Seabury Hall, Justin's old high school. Seabury is not only a beautiful place and fantastic wedding venue, but also a place of memory and history. A number of childhood friends and family connections still live on the island, and our closest friends and most immediate family members approved the idea of a celebration on Maui about seven years ago, when we first came up with the idea. For us, this "destination wedding" is an opportunity to share a beautiful and special place with those who are able to join us...

                        Normally, we'd book a hotel for the wedding… However, upcountry Maui isn't a typical destination. :) Instead, we recommend you get a good package deal with hotel, flight, and rental car. To help you plan, here's a map showing where the wedding will be:

                    </p>
                    <p>However, the trip from the down country beach area to upcountry is not too long -- you could definitely stay somewhere closer to the ocean and still be able to easily attend the wedding (for instance, Kihei and Wailea aren't super close, but they are lovely, will provide a resort experience, and aren't too far from the wedding). If you're traveling with a large group, renting a house might be the best option. Just make sure you use the map -- it wouldn't be fun to drive ALL the way from Hana or even from closer Lahaina to get to the wedding! :)</p>

                     Yes! That’s the main Maui airport and the airport you want to fly into.

                <h4>Where should we stay?</h4>
                <p>
                   We don’t have an easy answer to this, because there are so many options, variables for what you might want, and good deals. There are folks staying at Airbnb locations, folks renting houses, and folks getting package deals with airfare, hotel, and rental car. You can stay down country (warmer and closer to the beach) or up country (cooler and closer to the wedding).  Lahaina might be a little far (Google estimates it would take 50 minutes to an hour and 20 minutes to get to Seabury from Lahaina on our wedding day), but it would still be workable if you wanted to stay there.

                  <p>
                     Well, Maui has excellent hiking, snorkeling, and similar activities. A trip to the Seven Sacred Pools on the Hana side of the island would be an intense all day endeavour, but absolutely worth it unless you have a phobia about winding, narrow roads. :) A trip up to the Haleakala crater is definitely worth it, just don’t wear your bathing suit -- it gets much colder up at that higher elevation. Certain beaches have particularly great snorkeling, and others have other stand out characteristics.

                <h4>How should I dress for the wedding?</h4>
                  <p>
                   For the wedding, we'd like a casual but not too casual dress code. (No jeans, please! Collared shirts, which can include Hawaiian shirts, or a nice blouse. Khaki shorts would be fine.)</p>
                   <p>
If you want to dress up, it's fine to do so, as well. :) The bride will be wearing a traditional wedding dress, so you shouldn't worry about dressing up more than she does  :) It's an outdoor wedding on grass, so please plan accordingly.
:)

                     We plan to offer teriyaki chicken and sticky rice, with edamame as an alternative protein source. We'll also have stir fried veggies, fruit, and rolls.
